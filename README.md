# Final_Project

our final project named "Detection of Native Language Based on Micro Messages", dealt with automatic identification of the native language of a non-native English writerâ€™s anonymous text.
This work has never been done on short texts.
In this project, we built a machine learning based classification model, using Twitter as a corpus.
